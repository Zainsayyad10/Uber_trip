# 🚕 Trip Data Analysis Project

This project analyzes trip request data from a ride-sharing platform using **SQL** and **Python** (Pandas). The goal is to derive insights related to trip volume, cancellations, driver behavior, and operational patterns.

## 📁 Dataset Overview

The dataset contains detailed logs of ride requests, including:

- `Request id`
- `Pickup point` (City or Airport)
- `Driver id`
- `Request and Drop timestamps`
- `Trip Duration`
- `Status` and `Trip Status`
- `Request Hour`
  ## 📊 Key Insights Derived
  - 🚗 Total number of trips and completed trips  
- ❌ Cancellation rates by pickup point and hour  
- ⏰ Peak request hours and busy time periods
- Repeated cancellations and underperforming drivers
## 🛠️ Tools Used
 **MySQL** for writing queries and analysis
 **Excel** for cleaning the datset and creating an interactive dashboard
